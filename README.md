## About Me  

🎯 Focus: Frontend, TypeScript, A11Y, Develope Experience, frontend architecture

⚙️ Stack: React/Vue, Tailwind, Storybook, Playwright, GitHub Actions

📈 Strengths: Design-to-code execution, data-heavy UIs, scalable design systems, a11y-first development, visual QA & DX

Creative, test-driven senior frontend engineer with 5+ years’ experience delivering performant, accessible (WCAG AA) web applications. I specialize in building modular design systems, scalable dashboards, interactive tables, and high-impact data visualizations using React, Vue, TypeScript, and modern frontend tooling (Storybook, React, Vue.js, Tailwind, Playwright, CI/CD). I write semantic HTML, component-driven UIs, and testable code that scales; prioritizing user experience, performance, and maintainability.

I recently worked in ESG transforming vast, unstructured datasets from global corporations into intuitive, scalable UI tools. With experience supporting platforms for 20,000+ facilities and millions of data points, I thrive in collaborative, fast-paced environments and love solving complex frontend problems with simplicity and elegance.
